## 🚨 The Problem: AI Package Hallucinations
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude are revolutionizing coding, but they come with a dangerous side effect: **Package Hallucination**.

* **The Threat:** LLMs often suggest library imports that *sound* real but do not exist (e.g., `huggingface-cli-v2` instead of `huggingface-hub`).
* **The Attack Vector:** Malicious actors can scan widely generated AI code, identify these "fake" names, and register them on PyPI or NPM.
* **The Consequence:** When a developer copy-pastes the AI's code and runs `pip install`, they unknowingly download malware instead of a helper library.

## 💡 The Solution: Sentinel
**Sentinel** is a real-time security auditor that acts as a firewall between AI-generated code and your development environment. It scans GitHub repositories and analyzes dependencies to detect:

1. **Hallucinations:** Packages that are imported but do not exist in official registries.
2. **Typosquatting:** Packages with names dangerously similar to popular libraries (e.g., `reqests` vs `requests`).
3. **Abandonment:** Libraries that haven't been updated in years and pose security risks.

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Algorithm)

Our engine utilizes a multi-layered approach to verify package integrity:

### 1. Registry Verification Protocol
We cross-reference every dependency found in `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, and `README.md` against the live **PyPI (Python)** and **NPM (Node.js)** APIs. If a package returns a 404, it is flagged as a potential **Critical Risk (Hallucination)**.

### 2. Levenshtein Distance & RapidFuzz
To detect **Typosquatting**, we use the `rapidfuzz` library to calculate the Levenshtein Distance (string similarity ratio) between the scanned package and a whitelist of the top 5,000 most popular open-source packages.
* *Threshold:* If similarity is >90% but not an exact match, it is flagged as **High Risk**.

### 3. File Parser Engine
Our custom RegEx parser intelligently scans codebases for:
* Python: `pip install`, `import`, and `requirements.txt` syntax.
* Node.js: `npm install`, `package.json`, and `import` statements.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **✅ Cross-Ecosystem Support:** Seamlessly checks both Python (PyPI) and Node.js (NPM) ecosystems.
* **⚡ Real-Time Scanning:** Scans an entire GitHub repository in seconds.
* **🛡️ "Red Alert" UI:** Instantly visualizes Critical vs. Safe dependencies.
* **🧠 Context-Aware Parsing:** Ignores built-in modules (like `os`, `sys`, `fs`) to reduce false positives.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run Sentinel locally for testing.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* Node.js & npm
* Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/yashmakra/code-guardian.git
cd code-guardian
```
### 2. Setup Backend (FastAPI)

## Navigate to backend
```Bash
cd backend
```

## Create virtual environment (Windows)
```Bash
py -3.11 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Install dependencies
```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start the Server
```Bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. Setup Frontend (React)

Open a new terminal:
## Navigate to project root
```Bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Start the UI
```Bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 to access the dashboard.

## 📊 Research & Methodology
We believe that security tools must be transparent. Our detection logic is based on the research by **Bar Lanyado** regarding "AI Package Hallucinations" and the rise of software supply chain attacks.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
* **IDE Extension:** A VS Code plugin to warn developers as they paste code from ChatGPT.
* **CI/CD Integration:** A GitHub Action to block Pull Requests that introduce hallucinated packages.
* **Malware Analysis:** Deep scanning of the package code itself, not just the name.
